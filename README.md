## Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## The company wants to know:
+Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
+How well those variables describe the bike demands

## The Solution is divided into the following sections:
+Reading and Understanding the Data
+Data Visualisation
+Drop Unnecessary Columns
+Data Preparation
+Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
+Rescaling the Features
+Building a linear model
+Residual Analysis of the train data
+Making Predictions
+Model Evaluation
